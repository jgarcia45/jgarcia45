My name is Juan Garcia. I am currently attending a Coding Bootcamp to being a Full Stack Web Developer at Michigan State University.

## Projects
ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on learning how to develop in React. I am practicing by working on trying to improve my personal website/portfolio. This is my current website: [Website](https://juanalfredogarciajr.com/).  I have the source code listed here: [Source Code](https://github.com/jgarcia45/jgarcia45.github.io). I am hoping to transform my website into a well organized and pretty design to showcase my resume/portfolio using React.
