### Hi there 👋

I am currently working as a warehouser worker for Target. I am hoping to be a full time Software Engineer in the future. 
🔭 I’m currently working on learning how to develop in React. I am practicing by working on trying to improve my personal website/portfolio. This is my current website: [Website](https://juanalfredogarciajr.com/).  I have the source code listed here: [Source Code](https://github.com/jgarcia45/jgarcia45.github.io). I am hoping to transform my website into a nice website using React.
